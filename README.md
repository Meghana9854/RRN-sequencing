# RRN sequencing #
This repository conatins scripts used for taxonomically classifying RRN reads using two approaches: (i) direct alignment with Minimap2 (refer RRN_minimap2), and (ii) OTU clustering utilising vsearch, followed by classification via QIIME2 (refer RRN_OTUs). Additionally, it includes scripts for the classification of v3-v4 reads through OTU clustering with vsearch and subsequent QIIME2 classification (refer v3-v4_Illumina).
