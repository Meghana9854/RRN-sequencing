# RRN operon sequencing #
This repository contains pipelines (more to be added) for QC and analysis of long read amplicon data for the RRN (16S-ITS-23S) operon generated through PacBio sequencing. The pipeline uses vsearch for OTU clustering and qiime2 for taxonomic assignment of the OTUs generated.  
####### this repository is still under development #######
