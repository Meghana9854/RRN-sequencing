# RRN operon sequencing #
This repository contains pipelines (more to be added) for QC and analysis of long read amplicon data for the RRN (16S-ITS-23S) operon generated through PacBio sequencing. The pipeline uses vsearch for OTU clustering and qiime2 for taxonomic assignment of the OTUs generated.  
An RRN specfic reference database called FANGORN has been used for taxonomic classification, which has been development by Calum Walsh. More details of which can be found on https://github.com/cazzlewazzle89/FANGORN. 

####### this repository is still under development #######
